A very simple wrapper around the [PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me/) api using [reqwest](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/) and [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde).
It closely follows the structure of the API itself, and as such the official [API documentation](https://pluralkit.me/api/) is likely the best resource for now.

If you have any suggestions or run into any issues please let me know on [GitHub](https://github.com/lynxize/pkrs/), and contributions are definitely welcome!
