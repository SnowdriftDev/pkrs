# pkrs
A very simple wrapper around the [PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me/) api using [reqwest](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/) and [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde).
It closely follows the structure of the API itself, and as such the official [API documentation](https://pluralkit.me/api/) is likely the best resource for now.

**Disclaimer:** I'm fairly new to Rust, so this crate likely doesn't follow sensible best practices.  

If you have any suggestions or run into any issues please let me know on [GitHub](https://github.com/SnowdriftDev/pkrs/)!
