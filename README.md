# pkrs
A very simple wrapper around the [PluralKit](https://pluralkit.me/) api using [reqwest](https://docs.rs/reqwest/latest/reqwest/) and [serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde).
It closely follows the structure of the API itself, and as such the official [API documentation](https://pluralkit.me/api/) is likely the best resource for now.

> **Warning**  
> This crate is *very* much a **work in progress**, and is very unstable.   
> Breaking changes are made often, and no stability should be assumed until `v1.0` is released.
>
> Additionally, I'm fairly new to Rust in general, so this crate likely doesn't follow sensible best practices.
 
For now the only testing consists of me attempting to make projects using this, and discovering issues as I go along. Actual tests will come Someday:tm:, if all goes well.
 

If you have any suggestions or run into any issues please let me know on [GitHub](https://github.com/lynxize/pkrs/), and contributions are definitely welcome!
